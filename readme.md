# Collections in Rust 2021

by Zachary Bennett

Rust is a powerful programming language that helps you to develop systems and applications that are safe and efficient.
This course will teach you how to use collections in Rust so that you can write Rust code that performs reliably and
runs fast.

Learning about collections in programming languages can be difficult. In this course, Collections in Rust 2021, you’ll
learn how to use collections in Rust in a way that is practical and easy to understand so that you can build safe and
reliable systems. First, you’ll explore the fundamentals of collections in Rust. Next, you’ll discover how to manage
collections in memory. Finally, you’ll learn how to create iterators, use collections concurrently, and you’ll even
learn how to write your own custom collections. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and
knowledge of collections in Rust needed to solve problems in any domain using the Rust programming language.
